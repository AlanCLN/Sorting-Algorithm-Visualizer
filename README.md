# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

## Background

Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is an application that allows users to observe the intermediate steps of popular sorting algorithms (i.e. bubbleSort, quickSort, mergeSort). Some features include adjusting the speed at which the graph is sorted and selecting the amount of datapoints you would like to sort.
